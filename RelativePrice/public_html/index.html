                <h1>The opportunity</h1>
Companies around the world are studying you as a consumer. They figure out what you do, what your whereabouts are, which movies you watch, find out if you are pregnant, catch glimpses of your privacy. Anything that can turn you into a profit.

Their promotions? Are they lies to lure us to the shops?

I believe we should turn the favor around and crunch the numbers on the companies as well. Which company can give you the best prices? Can we do analysis on the companies? We as a consumer need to get smarter.
<h1>Aren't there companies that do this?</h1>
Sure there are. But they have their downsides. They have a limited budget and don't harvest the power of crowd-sourcing. Some companies even focus their prices on their inspections.

<h1>Strategy</h1>
To do this we'd like to create a database with all the groceries, electronics, ... prices out there and register them for each store you visit. To help you shop intelligently we combine your location, the available stores and the brands you buy to provide you the best places to buy whatever you need.

That way companies that offer lower prices for the same product are rewarded and you can shop more intelligently, save some money and do something for the environment as well.
<h2>data warehouse</h2>
The data warehouse is a publicly funded opensource web application with a REST API that allows you to upload your data and view the stores near you that have what you need at the lowest prices.
<h2>Apps</h2>
We will write apps to help you scan prices and associate them to  stores.
<h2>What can you do?</h2>
What can you do? This project is crowd-sourced. That means we depend on your input of what the prices are and which store you got that price.
